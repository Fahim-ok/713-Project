Precise power load forecasting is crucial for successful Smart Grid management, however it poses difficulties due to the nonlinear
nature of electricity use. Although deep learning has showed potential across numerous areas, its usage in load forecasting requires a
careful study. This paper fills the gap by providing a complete evaluation of alternative deep learning architectures for immediate power
demand prediction, utilizing actual energy consumption data. We offer TempFocusNet, a hybrid model that mixes Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) dependency learning with the temporal attention method to improve prediction accuracy. Therefore, our system
covers renewable energy usage with rapid decision-making. T
